## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in "Kaiteki" please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Email**: Send an email to [security@kaiteki.com](mailto:security@kaiteki.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been addressed.

2. **Expectation**: You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours, and we will keep you updated on the progress of the issue.

3. **Assessment**: Our team will assess the reported vulnerability and determine its impact and severity.

4. **Fix and Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed and fixed, we will develop and test the patch. We will then coordinate with you to establish an appropriate timeline for public disclosure.

Please note:

- We strive to address and resolve security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
- If the reported vulnerability is accepted, we will credit you in the release notes for your responsible disclosure.
- If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide reasons for our decision and encourage you to retest with future releases.

Remember that "Kaiteki" is still in development, so security is a priority as we work towards a stable release.
